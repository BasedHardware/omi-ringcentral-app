Before running the app, you need to add the redirect URI to your RingCentral application settings:

1. Go to [RingCentral Developer Console](https://developers.ringcentral.com/console)
2. Select your application
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "OAuth Settings"
4. Add this redirect URI:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback
   ```
5. Save your changes

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000

Visit http://localhost:3000 to get started
```

### 3. Use the App

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click **"Login with RingCentral"**
3. Authorize the application
4. Start sending messages!

## Example Commands

- Be specific with channel names for better accuracy
- The app uses OpenAI to understand your natural language input

## Troubleshooting

This requires `nodemon` which is already included in the dependencies.
